### ‣ [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/FloydFernandes/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/projects/Simple%20linear%20Regression) <a name="slr"></a>
  * [Delivery Time Prediction](https://github.com/FloydFernandes/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/projects/Simple%20linear%20Regression/Delivery%20Time%20SLR%20model.ipynb): This model has just 1 feature i.e. Sorting Time. The target was to predict the Delivery time using the 'Sorting Time' variable. The given data was transformed to find the best suited model. 

    * *Metrics used for checking accuracy: R-squared, RMSE (root mean squared error)*
    * *Tools used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, seaborn*

  * [Salary Prediction](https://github.com/FloydFernandes/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/projects/Simple%20linear%20Regression/Salary%20SLR%20model.ipynb): Used the x variable 'YearsExperience' to predict the y variable 'Salary'. The data had a very linear correlation and therefore no transformations were required. This was proved by making different transformation and checking the metrics.
